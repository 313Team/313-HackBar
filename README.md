### HOW TO INSTALL ON BROWSER?

<b>Note</b>: If you are using Firefox this is working only on v52.* bellow and you need disable "xpinstall.signatures.required" in config but if you are using [CyberFox Browser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberfox/) you don't need to disable the "xpinstall.signatures.required" because the cyberfox allowed all extention/add-ons.
 
Steps: //this on firefox browser
1. goto about:config
